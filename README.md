Benchmark for Assessing Large Language Models on Knowledge and Decision-Making Capacity in Osteoarthritis Treatment.
Osteoarthritis Treatment Benchmark
Overview

This repository contains the "Osteoarthritis Treatment Benchmark", a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess large language models on their knowledge and decision-making capacity in the management of osteoarthritis. The benchmark focuses on examining the adherence of these models to established clinical guidelines and evidence-based practices.
Purpose

The primary goal of this benchmark is to evaluate the capabilities of large language models in providing accurate, reliable, and guideline-compliant information and recommendations for the treatment of osteoarthritis. This benchmark serves as a tool for researchers and developers to understand the strengths and limitations of language models in medical contexts.
Features

    Knowledge Assessment: Tests the model's understanding of osteoarthritis.
    Decision-Making Evaluation: Examines the model's ability to make clinically sound treatment recommendations.
    Guideline Adherence: Assesses the model's recommendations against current clinical guidelines and best practices.
    Case Studies: Includes a variety of real osteoarthritis cases to test the model's practical application skills.

Usage

This benchmark can be used by AI researchers, healthcare professionals, and anyone interested in evaluating the medical knowledge and decision-making abilities of AI language models. To use the benchmark:

    Clone the repository.
    Follow the instructions in the usage_guide.md file.
    Run the benchmark tests using your preferred language model.
    Analyze the results using the provided evaluation criteria.
